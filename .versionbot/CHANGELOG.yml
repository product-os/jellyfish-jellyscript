        Functions for generating triggered actions based on specific formulas has
        been hoisted into the jellyfish worker: see
        https://github.com/product-os/jellyfish-worker/pull/1428/files

        This helps to draw clear boundaries around desired functionality. Jellyscript should not have knowledge of the workings of Jellyfish or of contracts.

      body: >
        Fixes #836


        This change takes the `getReferencedLinkVerbs` and makes it a generic

        object property search function, accessible as `Jellyscript.getObjectMemberExpressions()`.

        In a follow up a PR, the link verb specific function will be removed.

        This is a breaking change that makes `evaluatePatch`, `evaluate` and
        `evaluateObject` methods of a new `Jellyscript` class.

        Making this change allows us to add functionality for per-instance customization and options in the future.

        With this change, can now to provide an initial value to the AGGREGATE
        function.

        This change allows us to transition from using the special case handling of AGGREGATE, via a `triggered-action` and `action-set-add`, to an entirely formula based solution.

      body: |
        Previously, the behaviour of AGGREGATE would be different when called
        using the $events special value, or when it was called in another
        formula. This change makes the default AGGREGATE behaviour the same as
        when it is handled as a special case with $events.

      hash: 7075cabd265fa988959ce43887d237ffd2143a8e
      body: |
        As of jellyfish-worker v7, action-requests generated from triggered
        actions are always re-enqueued as new jobs and the `schedule` field is
        no longer used. This change removes the redundant fields from the
        triggered actions used for formula evaluation.

    - subject: Make 'this' context object also available as 'contract'.
      hash: d0212076e20a98af7fa1e0042ed01b88e1c42bd3
      body: |
        This is an intermediate step towards removing 'this' as a context
        object when evaluating expressions using static-eval (as it causes
        problems due to being a restricted keyword).

        The next step will involve modifying the evaluate and evaluateObject
        functions so that evaluate is not opinionated about naming context
        variables.

        In the meantime, we log a warning if the old 'this' reference is still
        found in the code.
